# React Native Migration Summary (v0.80+)

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of the project to React Native 0.80.1 and React 19.1.0, including all major codebase changes, new patterns, and upgrade steps.

---

## Major Changes

### 1. React Native & React Upgrades
- Upgraded `react-native` to 0.80.1 and `react` to 19.1.0.
- All dependencies and devDependencies updated to latest compatible versions.

### 2. Navigation
- Migrated from `react-navigation` v3 to `@react-navigation/native` v6+ and `@react-navigation/stack` v6+.
- All navigation actions now use the new API (`navigation.navigate`, `CommonActions.reset`, etc.).
- Navigation params are accessed via `route.params` instead of `navigation.getParam`.
- Programmatic navigation resets use `CommonActions.reset`.
- Navigation ref forwarding updated for v6+ compatibility.

### 3. AsyncStorage
- All imports and usages of `AsyncStorage` now use `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
- No usage of deprecated `AsyncStorage` from `react-native` remains.

### 4. Lifecycle Methods
- All deprecated lifecycle methods (`componentWillMount`, typos, etc.) replaced with `componentDidMount` or `componentWillUnmount`.
- Class components retained, but now use only supported lifecycle methods.

### 5. Libraries.js Pattern
- Dynamic loading of native libraries continues via `libraries.js`.
- To add a new native library:
  ```js
  import * as MyNativeLib from 'my-native-library';
  export default {
    ...existingLibs,
    'my-native-library': MyNativeLib,
  };
  ```
- Ensure the library is installed and linked per React Native 0.80+ requirements.

### 6. Redux-form & ActionSheet
- Both libraries are retained and compatible with the new React Native version.

### 7. react-native-video
- No custom or advanced usage detected in the codebase. If issues arise, consult the [official migration guide](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video#upgrading) for compatibility notes.

## Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login flow
- [ ] App list and navigation
- [ ] Viewer screen and dynamic library loading
- [ ] Notifications and programmatic navigation
- [ ] AsyncStorage persistence
- [ ] All flows using ActionSheet and redux-form

## Additional Notes
- All deprecated APIs and patterns have been removed or updated.
- If you add new native modules, follow the `libraries.js` pattern above.
- For any issues with navigation or native modules, consult the latest React Native and library documentation.
